# BigData_kaggle_HM1
Big Data Homework1 kaggle, by Xiyao Ma
I write this Python code with Pycharm based on Convolutional Neural Network. First, I used two convolutional layers, and apply Relu layer and max pooling layer after each conv layer. Second, I used two fully-connected(FC) layers then, and I apply Relu and dropout on the output of the first FC layer, and apply softmax function on the output of the second FC layer.
